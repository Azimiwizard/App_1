# AI Integration Implementation Plan (Budget-Conscious)

## Overview
Integrate an AI agent to handle real-time calls and WhatsApp chats using Twilio, with conversational AI powered by OpenAI GPT or open-source alternatives. Automate order placement using n8n workflows connected to Google Sheets. Integrate an order placement screen into the existing Flask app.

---

## Step 1: Twilio Setup
- Create a Twilio account and activate the free trial.
- Obtain Twilio phone number with voice and WhatsApp capabilities.
- Configure Twilio webhook URLs for voice calls and WhatsApp messages.

## Step 2: Conversational AI Agent
- Choose AI platform:
  - Use OpenAI GPT API with usage limits to control costs.
  - Alternatively, deploy an open-source conversational AI model on low-cost hosting.
- Develop a lightweight Flask or FastAPI microservice to handle AI interactions.
- Implement endpoints to receive Twilio webhook requests and respond with AI-generated replies.

## Step 3: n8n Workflow Automation
- Set up n8n (self-hosted or free tier).
- Create workflows to:
  - Receive AI agent outputs.
  - Parse order details.
  - Insert orders into Google Sheets or preferred sheet service.

## Step 4: Order Placement Screen
- Design and implement an order placement UI within the existing Flask app.
- Connect the UI to the backend to display and manage orders from the sheet or database.

## Step 5: Orchestration and Testing
- Use Twilio Studio or n8n to orchestrate call and chat flows.
- Test end-to-end flow: customer call/chat → AI interaction → order placement.
- Monitor usage and optimize to stay within budget.

## Next Steps
- Begin with Twilio account setup and webhook configuration.
- Develop AI microservice prototype.
- Set up n8n workflows.
- Implement order placement screen in Flask app.
